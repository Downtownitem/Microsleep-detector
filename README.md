# Microsleep Detector
## Project Description
The developed project is a microsleep detector designed to identify moments when a person closes their eyes for an extended period, which could indicate a microsleep. The application uses a camera that must always be on to monitor the person's eyes and alert them in case a microsleep is detected.

## Tools Used
OpenCV (cv2): Computer vision library used to process camera images.
MediaPipe: Machine learning library for image processing, used to detect and track facial landmarks.
